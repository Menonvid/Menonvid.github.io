Searching for jobs has never been easy. But things were different until last year. Networking has always been important, but that used to happen face to face and it was easier to convince or convey your thoughts and ideas to people as to why you are a good fit for the respective roles. 

In today's time, when networking too has become virtual, many-a-times you don't even see the person with whom you are talking to, convincing them that you can fit the role can be tough. The words that we speak and the tone in which we talk play a very important role. We need to pay a lot of attention to how we talk and covey ourselves. 

Apart from that, its also important to network with people online. Cold networking has been very instumental connecting with people who we don't know. Some tips to consider while cold networking is :

**Identifying the right people**: LinkedIn is a great place to connect with people. Connecting with people with same background, or people having the path  that you are planning to take can be the right source with whom you can connect.

**Recruiters**: Getting the recruiters to respond to you or connect with you can be a big task. But don't give up. Keep connecting with them and some will surely connect and respond back.

**Be specific**: People are busy and don't have time for stories. Thus, its important to keep it short and be specific as to what you want from them. 

**Keep it simple**: While its important to be short and sweet, one more thing that is important is to keep it simple. Avoid using powerful and negative words.

Remember, networking means building a relationship which you don't want to start on a wrong foot. Being honest is very important. People hate it when we try to be fake. Well, the oath may not be easy and can be stressful, the matra is not to loose hope and keep going further. Your success is just around the corner.
