What a year this has been, 6 months are over, and it gets worse every day with all the happenings around the world. And what a year to have chosen to do this course. But sometimes I feel, had it not been for the Data Science course that I am pursuing, it would have completely broken me down. The struggle to get a job, I never thought I would get to such a point in my life. I had never been idle from the time I completed my graduation. Got a placement when I was in my last semester of college. From then it had been just work, work and more work.

But we had to shift to US when my husband had to come here for work. I was not very thrilled at the idea of sitting at home, but I gave it a try. It was a struggle. I did not know what to do since I had never gone through it. That too being so far away from my home and family. And then I had the gift of my life, I gave birth to my son. So, I thought to be at home for some more time since he needed my love and care.

Soon my patience started to give up and I decided to get back to work. By then it had been 5 years since I had worked. It did not take long for me to realize that it was not going to be easy. My first interview was horrible. I was shocked that I had forgotten everything. It just made me feel worse. But with the help of my family and friends, I just went through all my working years trying to recollect what I had accomplished. The second interview was much better and the third was good. But I always knew that I had to keep up with the changes in the world of technology while I was away. I had suggestions from many saying that I should start studying but was always searching for the right fit.

Finally, I got to know about the Data Science course in Flatiron School. I was very apprehensive to take it up, but my family encouraged me to go for it. I was not sure if I would be able to give it the time it needs to complete the course successfully and to become a good Data Scientist. But here I am, writing this blog, in the last month of my course. These last 5 months have not been easy and trust me when I say it was not at all easy. And with all the optimism in me, and thanks to my coach and my friends in my school, I am heading towards completing my course

Hoping to become good Data Scientist and showcasing my skills on the field. The thought of it makes me happyâ€¦ðŸ˜Š
