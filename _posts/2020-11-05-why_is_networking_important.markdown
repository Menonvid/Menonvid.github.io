Networking is very important in today's world specially where we all are getting used to the 'New Normal' of online meetings and greetings. Networking is not just exchanging information about each other but it is also a means to build long lasting relationships. Human beings are 'Social Animals' and this is for a reason. 'I' cannot survive alone. 'I' need 'We' to survive not just personally but professionally too and for this reason Networking plays a huge role.

People with successful careers will definitely agree that one of the biggest reasons for their success is the strong networking channels they have created over time. But the question remains, whom should you network with. There are some points that we should consider before networking as its practically impossible to network with everyone. There should be a clear agenda when we connect with someone and not every connection is going to be helpful.

 - **Means for New opportunities** : it opens up new paths to connect with people and find the right opportunities for you.

 - **Getting noticed** : As you start connecting with more and more people, not only do you get to know about the opportunities but also people start noticing you, which in turn may bring more opportunities.

 - **Periodic Self-Assessment** : As we connect with people, we get to know about their career and the paths that they have chosen to reach there. This can help us evaluate ourselves and also realize which areas may need improvement.

- **Confidence booster** : As we network with people, interact with defferent people, it helps us improve our confidence. Building up confidence also helps us to perform better in interviews. As you keep growing your network, your confidence also builds up with time.

- **Build long lasting relationships** : Networking is a mutual relationship and connecting with the right people can help you build your career. It also helps in building long lasting relationships by making it a two way process of giving and taking.

Keep networking, and work towards building your career.
